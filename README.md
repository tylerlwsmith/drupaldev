# Drupal Dev: Hugo

This site will be a living document of my notes while I am getting up-and-running with Drupal. I would have built this site with Drupal, except I couldn't figure out how to get the Book module to display the full outline of a book with all sub-chapters expanded.

I hope to port this over once I understand more about Drupal.
