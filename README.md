# Drupal Dev: Hugo

This site will be a living document of my notes while I am getting up-and-running with Drupal. I would have built this site with Drupal, except I couldn't figure out how to get the Book module to display the full outline of a book with all sub-chapters expanded.

I hope to port this over once I understand more about Drupal.

## Local development

This site uses the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator, so it must be installed before you get started.

Once installed, you can start the development server with the following command:

```sh
hugo server
```

To develop _with_ draft posts enabled, run the following:

```sh
hugo server -D
```

## Icons

This site uses [Feather icons](https://feathericons.com/) exported to SVGs using a `1.5px` stroke.
